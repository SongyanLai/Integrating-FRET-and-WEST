## üéØ Project Abstract

Development of safety-critical systems needs stringent requirements specification and verification to prevent catastrophic failure. This research accounts for syntac-tic and semantic differences between two formal verification tools: FRET, which generates Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) from natural language requirements; WEST, which works with Mission-time LTL (MLTL) formulas. This study cre-ates tool support for the automatic translation of the temporal logic generated by FRET to the temporal logic format expected by WEST. This translation is syntac-tically bridging and semantically preserving with bidirectional traceability to pri-mal requirements. Our solution utilizes regular expression-based mapping, varia-ble normalization, and mission-time interval translation to transform FRET's LTL specifications to WEST's MLTL syntax. A proof-of-concept JavaScript translator iteratively constructed through case studies, was incorporated as a feature within the FRET tool. Comparative validation in collaboration with the MU-FRET and WEST teams confirmed the efficacy of the framework. This research demon-strates enhanced reliability and efficiency in safety-critical requirements engineer-ing, with future research on semantic equivalence verification, cloud-native de-ployment, and human-centric interfaces.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work

1. **Automated Translation Framework**
   A JavaScript translator that resynchronizes FRET's LTL to WEST's MLTL reduces manual translation time in industrial case studies. Furthermore, Innovations include Regex operator rewriting, finite-to-infinite trace emulation, and adaptive temporal granularity synchronization for real-time constraints.
2. **Semantic-Preserving Heuristics**
   Problem-domain-specific rule sets maintain logical equivalence during conflicts in mission-time intervals and nesting operator alignment. The ability to reconfigure resolution parameters minimizes quantization errors for safety-critical uses.
3. **Toolchain Interoperability**
   Mutual traceability provides linkages of MLTL results with FRETish requirements that are auditable and iteratively refineable. Further, open-source release induces co-operation amongst academia (Maynooth University, Iowa State University) and industry (KBR/NASA Ames Research Center).
4. **Empirical Validation**
   Case studies show 85% syntactic correctness and 80% semantic similarity.

## üîÆ Future Directions

1. **Semantic Equivalence Verification**
   Integrate SMT solvers (e.g., Z3) formally establish equivalence between FRET's LTL and MLTL translation.
2. **Multi-Tool Redundancy**
   Expand integration to runtime monitors (e.g., R2U2) and probabilistic checkers (e.g., PRISM).
3. **Cloud-Native Scalability**
   Execute containerized WEST instances on AWS/Azure for mission-scale verification.
4. **Human-Centric Interfaces**
   Develop AI-enabled annotation tools to map validation errors back to FRETish requirements.
