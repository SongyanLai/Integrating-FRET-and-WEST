## üéØ Project Abstract

This research focuses on integrating FRET and WEST to enhance requirements traceability in safety-critical systems. FRET, originally developed by NASA‚Äôs Software Verification and Validation team and later refined into MU-FRET, translates natural language requirements into Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), while the WEST tool validates Mission-time LTL (MLTL) formulas by generating corresponding regular expressions. The project involves a detailed examination of FRET, WEST, and related LTL frameworks, alongside mainstream formal verification tools, to identify the necessity for integration and to pinpoint limitations within WEST. Central to the study is the development of an interconversion process between LTL and MLTL that ensures compatibility with WEST‚Äôs syntax, utilizing regular expression-based mapping, variable normalization, and mission-time interval translation. A proof-of-concept JavaScript translator, refined through aerospace and medical case studies and incorporated as a feature within FRET, has reduced manual work by 85% and eliminated 80% of syntax differences, with comparative validation from the lead developers of both tools confirming its efficacy. For more details, please refer to 'Final Report.pdf'.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work

1. **Automated Translation Framework**
   A JavaScript translator that resynchronizes FRET's LTL to WEST's MLTL reduces manual translation time in industrial case studies. Furthermore, Innovations include Regex operator rewriting, finite-to-infinite trace emulation, and adaptive temporal granularity synchronization for real-time constraints.
2. **Semantic-Preserving Heuristics**
   Problem-domain-specific rule sets maintain logical equivalence during conflicts in mission-time intervals and nesting operator alignment. The ability to reconfigure resolution parameters minimizes quantization errors for safety-critical uses.
3. **Toolchain Interoperability**
   Mutual traceability provides linkages of MLTL results with FRETish requirements that are auditable and iteratively refineable. Further, open-source release induces co-operation amongst academia (Maynooth University, Iowa State University) and industry (KBR/NASA Ames Research Center).
4. **Empirical Validation**
   Case studies show 85% syntactic correctness and 80% semantic similarity.

## üîÆ Future Directions

1. **Semantic Equivalence Verification**
   Integrate SMT solvers (e.g., Z3) formally establish equivalence between FRET's LTL and MLTL translation.
2. **Multi-Tool Redundancy**
   Expand integration to runtime monitors (e.g., R2U2) and probabilistic checkers (e.g., PRISM).
3. **Cloud-Native Scalability**
   Execute containerized WEST instances on AWS/Azure for mission-scale verification.
4. **Human-Centric Interfaces**
   Develop AI-enabled annotation tools to map validation errors back to FRETish requirements.
